                <h1>Rumors About Me</h1>
                <p>On the internet, there is a whole sect of amateur detectives who invent incredible stories about me. Here’s a brief overview:</p>
                
                <h3>[RUMOR_01]: I am a prisoner.</h3>
                <p>Yes, according to the forum “experts,” I’m a hostage, kept by force and starved. <blockquote>“Is ehotlovea a hostage and is she being starved?”</blockquote></p>

                <h3>[RUMOR_02]: I am “controlled by a monster.”</h3>
                <p>According to the rumors, there’s some villain who forces me to work on camera against my will.</p>

                <h3>And now – to the facts.</h3>
                <p><strong>There is no villain, no captivity, and no drama whatsoever.</strong> There is me – an ordinary girl who set a goal and works hard to achieve it. Everything I have achieved is the result of my own effort, a well-thought-out strategy, and hard work. 🎓</p>
                <p>No one controls me. I want to mention the Chaturbate support team. These guys are true pros. 💙</p>
                <p>We have already uncovered the identity of that very storyteller (thanks to my clever Eric 😉). Legal steps will not take long.</p>
                <p>So what’s the bottom line? I continue to do my work and reach new heights. Thank you to all my true fans for your support and common sense. You are the best. ❤️</p>
