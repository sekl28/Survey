        <h2>Overview of GamblingCraft</h2>
        <p><strong>GamblingCraft</strong> is an affiliate program that has been operating for several years, representing a suite of online casinos primarily popular in the CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) and parts of Europe. The flagship brands under GamblingCraft include <strong>PlayFortuna</strong>, <strong>Booi Casino</strong>, and <strong>Jozz Casino</strong>, among others. These casinos are known for their solid game selections and localized offerings (multiple languages, currencies), which can make them attractive to promote if you have traffic in their target markets.</p>
        <p>One key advantage of GamblingCraft is that it consolidates multiple brands under one umbrella. This means as an affiliate, you can promote any or all of their brands and track performance in one place. The platform’s interface allows you to see combined stats or drill down by brand. Historically, GamblingCraft has a good reputation among affiliates for being trustworthy and partner-friendly – payments are on time, and the terms have remained fair. This stability is crucial in the often volatile world of affiliate marketing.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Commission Structure</h2>
        <p>The <strong>commission structure</strong> at GamblingCraft is quite lucrative. New affiliates typically start at a 25% revenue share, but this can scale up to 45-50% based on performance (i.e., the amount of Net Revenue you bring in per month). Hitting the top tier to get 50% rev share usually requires driving a significant volume of FTDs (First Time Depositors) and revenue, but even mid-level affiliates can enjoy 35-40% with consistent traffic.</p>
        <p>A major plus: GamblingCraft operates with <strong>no negative carryover</strong>. This means if one month your players win more than they lose (resulting in a negative balance for you), that negative amount is wiped clean at the start of the next month. You won’t be in the hole moving forward – a very affiliate-friendly policy that not all programs offer. Additionally, the earnings from all brands are combined for the purpose of calculating your commission tier. This bundling means if you promote multiple GamblingCraft casinos, all that revenue adds up to push you into higher commission brackets faster. (Conversely, it also means a big win at one brand could temporarily offset revenue from another in a given month, but thanks to no negative carryover, this isn't a long-term concern.)</p>
        <p>Besides revenue share, GamblingCraft may offer CPA (cost-per-acquisition) deals or hybrid deals on request, especially if you have a strong track record or high-value traffic. It’s worth discussing with your affiliate manager if you prefer a one-time bounty per player instead of (or in addition to) lifetime rev share. The flexibility is there, as the program has shown willingness to tailor deals for mutually beneficial outcomes.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Brands &amp; Markets</h2>
        <p>The casinos under GamblingCraft’s umbrella are particularly strong in Russia/CIS, Eastern Europe, and certain European countries. <strong>PlayFortuna</strong> is the most established brand, known for its wide range of slots and a loyal player base since around 2013. <strong>Booi</strong> is a newer, modern casino with a quirky theme and has gained popularity for its aggressive bonuses. <strong>Jozz</strong> is another brand in the portfolio, catering to similar regions.</p>
        <p>All these brands offer popular game providers (NetEnt, Microgaming, etc.), live casinos, and regular promotions for players, which helps conversion and retention. They tend to localize content effectively – multiple language options (Russian, English, maybe others) and support for local currencies and payment methods like WebMoney, Qiwi, or localized bank options, in addition to standard Visa/MasterCard and e-wallets. This localization means if your traffic is from those regions, the likelihood of conversion is higher than if you were sending them to a generic international casino lacking those options.</p>
        <p>While these brands might not have the global name recognition of, say, a Bet365 or 888, they are competitive within their target markets. As an affiliate, it’s important to align the program with your audience. GamblingCraft shines if you have or can tap into traffic in Eastern Europe or the CIS, where these casinos resonate well. For English-speaking markets like UK/US, these brands are less known and might not be as easy to convert. So, the program is fantastic for the right geo – and if that matches your traffic profile, it can be a goldmine.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Payments &amp; Affiliate Support</h2>
        <p>GamblingCraft has a track record of <strong>reliable payments</strong>. Commissions are calculated monthly and usually paid by the 15th of the following month (often sooner). The program offers multiple payout methods, including popular options like Skrill, Neteller, bank wire, or even cryptocurrencies (for affiliates who prefer Bitcoin, etc.). The minimum payout threshold is relatively low (around $100), which is convenient if you’re just starting out or have modest traffic.</p>
        <p>Another highlight is their affiliate support. Each affiliate is typically assigned a dedicated affiliate manager. From our experience and community feedback, the managers at GamblingCraft are helpful and responsive. They can assist with providing custom marketing materials (like localized banners or landing pages), exclusive bonus codes to help your promotions stand out, and they often share insights on which campaigns are performing well in certain markets. This guidance can be invaluable, effectively partnering with you to optimize results. The affiliate dashboard itself is fairly standard but provides all necessary stats like clicks, registrations, FTDs, and revenue. It’s updated regularly, allowing you to track how your campaigns are doing in near real-time.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p><strong>Our Verdict:</strong> GamblingCraft is a robust affiliate program for those targeting the markets its brands serve. The generous revenue share, coupled with no negative carryover, sets a favorable stage for earning consistent income. The fact that you can promote multiple strong casino brands at once is a big advantage – more choices for your audience, and consolidated earnings for you.</p>
        <p>We found GamblingCraft to be reliable and growth-oriented. They’re eager to help affiliates succeed, which is evident from their proactive support and willingness to discuss custom deals. If your website or marketing channels have traffic from Russia, CIS, or nearby regions, partnering with GamblingCraft could be highly profitable. On the other hand, if your audience is outside these regions, you might want to consider if the brands fit before diving in. Overall, for the right affiliate, GamblingCraft offers an excellent opportunity in 2025’s competitive iGaming affiliate landscape. <a href="#" class="button cta">Sign up for GamblingCraft</a> and turn your traffic into earnings with their top-notch program.</p>
