      <h2>My Story as a Binance Victim</h2>
      <p>I am a victim of Binance’s unjust practices. The company has unlawfully frozen €30,000 of my funds, refusing to return them. Despite all my attempts to resolve the issue through their support, Binance provided no legitimate justification for holding my money. It seems this huge company believes it can illegally hold users’ assets with impunity. Instead of giving up, I have decided to fight back and expose this injustice. My goal is not only to reclaim my own funds, but also to prevent others from suffering the same fate.</p>

      <h2>Campaign Budget and Expenses</h2>
      <p>I am investing a significant portion of my personal funds to bring this situation to light, and I will be fully transparent about all expenses. To date, I have spent:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>4 informational websites targeting key regions – <strong>€3,600</strong></li>
        <li>Technical SEO optimization for these 4 sites – <strong>€2,300</strong></li>
        <li>4 domain name purchases – <strong>€80</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>These expenses total €5,980 so far. I will continue to share all ongoing costs as the campaign progresses. I plan to allocate approximately 10% of my annual income to this effort. This means around <strong>€150,000</strong> will be spent in 2025 to ensure that Binance’s actions are exposed and addressed.</p>

      <h2>Action Plan</h2>
      <p>I have developed a multi-faceted action plan to seek justice and hold Binance accountable. This plan includes launching dedicated websites, engaging with top media outlets, pursuing legal action in multiple countries, pressuring regulatory authorities, and conducting a global public awareness campaign. The key phases of this plan are outlined below:</p>

      <h3>Phase 1: Online Outreach (Websites &amp; SEO)</h3>
      <p><strong>Building the platform:</strong> The first step has been to create dedicated websites to tell my story and inform the public. I have launched four websites targeting key geographic regions affected by Binance (with content tailored for those audiences). Each site is search engine optimized, and I have invested in technical SEO and professional optimization to ensure they rank highly for relevant searches. Additionally, I am purchasing strategic backlinks and references on other websites to boost these sites’ visibility. This online presence will help reach other Binance users and victims worldwide, making it easier for people to find information about this case.</p>

      <h3>Phase 2: Media Coverage and Publications</h3>
      <p><strong>Engaging top media:</strong> To amplify the exposure, I plan to publish articles in elite and widely read media outlets. For example, I am preparing an article for <em>Forbes</em> detailing how Binance has withheld €30,000 of my money and describing the broader implications of such fraud. We are also identifying other major publications in key regions (Europe, Turkey, Brazil, and beyond) where this story can be featured. By getting coverage in reputable news sources, I aim to bring international attention to Binance’s misconduct and put public pressure on the company.</p>

      <h3>Phase 3: Legal Action Across Countries</h3>
      <p><strong>Lawyers and police reports:</strong> I am engaging legal counsel in multiple countries to pursue formal action against Binance. In each target country — including Turkey, France, Italy, Brazil, and other EU jurisdictions — I will hire a local lawyer who can assist in filing official complaints and police reports regarding this case of fraud. These lawyers will gather testimonies and evidence, ensuring that my case (and similar cases from other victims) is reported to law enforcement in each region. We will collect as many individual complaints as possible and submit them en masse, demonstrating to authorities that Binance’s fraudulent practices are harming customers worldwide. By having legal actions underway in several countries simultaneously, we increase the pressure on Binance and create a record of wrongdoing in multiple jurisdictions.</p>

      <h3>Phase 4: Pressure on Regulatory Authorities</h3>
      <p><strong>Licensing and oversight:</strong> Beyond police and legal proceedings, I will be filing formal grievances with financial regulatory bodies that oversee or license Binance’s operations. In the European Union (for example, regulators in France and Italy) and other key regions, I will present the evidence of Binance’s misconduct and urge these agencies to take action, up to and including revoking Binance’s licenses to operate. The goal is to prompt regulatory investigations into Binance’s practices. If regulators do not respond adequately, I plan to escalate by publicly questioning and lodging complaints about the regulators themselves – highlighting the issue of how such a scam-ridden platform can continue to operate under their watch. Regulators have a duty to protect consumers, and we will demand that they enforce accountability on Binance. This phase aims to ensure that oversight authorities cannot ignore the growing number of fraud complaints.</p>

      <h3>Phase 5: Public Awareness Campaign</h3>
      <p><strong>Mobilizing users and investors:</strong> In tandem with the above efforts, I will launch a global awareness campaign to warn the public about Binance’s actions. This will include online advertisements and social media campaigns urging current Binance users to safeguard their assets. I will strongly encourage people to withdraw their funds from Binance accounts and to reconsider holding Binance’s own cryptocurrency (BNB). The warning message is that an investigation into Binance’s fraudulent activities is looming, and there is a real risk that funds could be frozen during a regulatory crackdown. By spreading this message, I hope to protect potential victims from loss and put additional pressure on Binance – if enough users withdraw and divest, Binance will feel the impact. As part of this campaign, I will also create a dedicated thread on Reddit where victims and concerned users can share their experiences and stay updated. I plan to promote this Reddit discussion across countries with targeted advertising, creating an international community of Binance’s victims and supporters. The more people who are aware and speaking out, the harder it will be for Binance or regulators to dismiss our case.</p>

      <p><strong>Standing together:</strong> I am funding this campaign entirely with my own hard-earned money because I believe justice is worth the cost. No company, no matter how large, should think it can get away with stealing its users’ money. I am determined to see Binance held accountable for its actions. My sincere hope is that this initiative will not only help me recover what was taken, but also save others from similar ordeals. If you have faced a situation like mine with Binance, know that you are not alone – together we can make our voices heard and demand justice. I will continue to post updates on this site (and on the upcoming Reddit thread) as the campaign progresses. Thank you for your support.</p>
